# Multiple-linear-regression
A multiple regression model to predict the taxi fares using existing data that was collected over a year. 

The data consulting firm Automatidata has recently got a project. Their newest client called NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (New York City TLC), wants the Automatidata team to build a multiple linear regression model to predict taxi fares using existing data that was collected over the course of a year. The team is getting closer to completing the project, having completed an initial plan of action, initial Python coding work, EDA, and A/B testing.
The Automatidata team has reviewed the results of the A/B testing. Now itâ€™s time to work on predicting the taxi fare amounts.
